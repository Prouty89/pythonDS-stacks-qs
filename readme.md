### Abstract Data Types ( ADTs )

A theoretical concept to specify what kind of data a data structure can hold and what operations are allowed on that data

An abstract data type just expresses an idea! Interaction, not implementation!

Language Agnostic

From the perspective of the ADT, not the person

## Imperative vs Functional styles of ADT

### Imperative ADT

- The ADT is Mutable
- The same ADT can take on different states
The order in which operations are executed matters, the style for this course. 

### Functional ADT

- The ADT is immutable

A separate instance of the ADT for each new state

- The order in which operations are executed does not matter

### The advantages of ADT

- Abstraction

Predictable properties, all a user needs to know is the allowable data types and operations. 
No understanding of the implementation is required. 

- Consistency

The implementation can change as long as the interface to the data structure stays the same
The user doesnt have to alter their code.


## Data Structures (DS)

- Concrete implementations of ADTs that organize and retrieve data stored in memory

- Talked about from the perspective of the programmer

### 1 ADT operation = 1 function in DS
- Often > 1 implementation of an ADT
